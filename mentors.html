											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I was born and raised in Ecuador, but I’ve also lived in a bunch of states in the USA. I am constantly craving travel, the outdoors, &amp; culturally diverse environments. I enjoy learning new skills (and languages) and also love climbing, playing ukulele, being with loved ones, etc.! Some topics I am passionate about: the environment, social justice, animal rights, &amp; diversity & inclusion in STEM (outreach).
											</br></br>
											I am a 2nd year grad student and I work with Jonelle Walsh. Currently, I am working with data from the Mitchell IFS (McDonald Observatory) and GMOS IFS (Gemini Observatory) to do dynamical mass modeling of nearby massive early-type galaxies. I am really interested in galaxy formation and evolution, and studying the central black hole in nearby galaxies is a great way to understand different types of galaxies and how they evolve with their SMBH through cosmic time.  In my undergrad, I was a part of a few research projects studying high-z submillimeter galaxies, H-alpha variability of young low-mass stars, and satellite galaxies of Milky Way analogs (with Louie!).

											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I’m originally from Oklahoma and my ultimate goal is to convince all of my friends to buy a plot of land together so we can build houses next to each other and share a garden (hmu if you’re interested). When I’m not debugging code or thinking about the cosmos, I enjoy creating art, primarily through poetry, drawing, and graphic design but I enjoy all kinds of self-expression! I try to seek out inspiration wherever & whenever I can and I love spending time with my friends. Sometimes I get tired though and I spend the weekend watching movies instead. 
											</br></br>
											I’m a second year graduate student working with Louis Strigari in the Milky Way Group. I have several research interests but my main pursuit is seeking to understand more about the particle nature of dark matter and its role in cosmic-scale structures. To do this, I study a combination of the stellar kinematics of galactic objects as well as the radiation coming from these systems. I’m also interested in ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. Basically I’m a fan of radiation physics.

											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I'm one of those first-gen, low-income, hispanic, single mom, blah blah blah kind of students.  I'm currently living with a seven year old and a dog (both very active) in Northgate.  I like to read, hang out & drink with friends (I'm fairly social), play music poorly, study Spanish, and tell people how to live their lives :)
											</br></br>
											Currently, I’m a 5th year grad student and I'm part of the galactic group working with Louie.  I'm hoping to head into industry after grad school, so my current plan is to do a 5-year PhD with a heavy emphasis on computation and statistical analysis.  I work with photometric data on objects like dwarf galaxies and globular clusters to constrain their nature and properties.  In the past (i.e., undergrad), I've worked on projects dealing with asteroids and lightcurves, neutron stars and their pasta, and anything to do with python and/or breaking my computer's OS (I still do this one now).</p>

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Jonathan Cohn</font></h3>
											<h5>he / him / his</h5>
											<p>I'm originally from St. Louis, Missouri, but I lived in Dallas for a while before I came to College Station for grad school. I'm a classically trained (albeit rather out-of-practice) violinist, and I was a competitive figure skater for about 10 years. I love running around outside, reading books (NK Jemisin, Neil Gaiman), playing tabletop games (especially RPGs), and listening to all sorts of music.
											</br></br>
											I'm a 5th year grad student working with Jonelle Walsh, making dynamical models to estimate the mass of supermassive black holes based on molecular gas observations from ALMA. I am particularly interested in the co-evolution (or not) of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies. In the past, I've worked on modeling gravitational microlensing by stellar mass binary black holes in the Milky Way, as well as using SED-fitting to constrain the star formation histories of emission-line galaxies and star-forming galaxies at z~2.5-4.

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Yaswant Devarakonda</font></h3>
											<h5>he / him / his</h5>
											<p>I've spent almost my entire life in Texas: first in the Houston suburbs and then in Austin for undergrad, so I know my way around the state and those two cities in particular. I've got a dog named Lulu, who is an adorable schnauzer mix. Outside of science, I like cooking, playing board games and tabletop RPGs such as D&D, playing video games, and reading. I'm also a big sports fan. I support the Texans in the NFL, the Dynamo in MLS, and Chelsea in the Premiere League. I try to be a good ally for minorities in STEM, and I support diversity, inclusivity, and intersectionality initiatives.
											</br></br>
											I’m a 3rd year grad student, and my current research is with Jonelle, trying to constrain the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby galaxies. The hope is to get a wide sample of galaxies in order to better understand how galaxies and their SMBHs co-evolve. In general, I am interested in galaxy evolution and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In my undergrad I studied high redshift, star-forming galaxies. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do in the future, but my current leaning is toward studying the role of AGN in suppressing star formation. I'm also interested and involved in astronomy outreach and education.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Peter Ferguson</font></h3>
											<h5>he / him / his</h5>
											<p>I’m originally from Denver, Colorado and I went to undergrad at a small liberal arts school in Philadelphia, and then took 3 years off of school before starting here (I tried a bunch of non academic things and decided I really, REALLY liked astronomy). In College Station, I play ultimate frisbee, listen to lotsa music/watch too many music videos, and hangout/eat out/cook/play board games with friends!
											</br></br>
											I’m a 5th year grad student and I find myself interested in most areas of astronomy (AKA I’m very excitable), but for my PhD I am focusing on Milky Way science and a separate instrumentation project. Currently, I’m (1) working with Louie on using RR Lyrae to understand the spatial structure in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and (2) working with Darren/Luke on a calibration system to measure the relative transmission of a telescope + instrument. (In the past, I have also worked with Jen and Casey.) I am also interested in how we can use chemical abundances, kinematics, and positions of stars to understand the formation of our galaxy -- such as understanding R-Process sites from observations or measuring the velocities and metallicites of streams and ultra faint dwarf galaxies. I also enjoy thinking and talking about statistics, in particular spatial statistics and Bayesian hierarchical modeling.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Micalyn Rowe</font></h3>
											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I am a born and raised Texan, and I am half Filipina and half white. I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Physics with a minor in Astronomy from Texas A&M University-Commerce. I love to read books, spend time outdoors with Heath (human partner) and Beans (doggie), watch interesting TV, photograph special moments, travel, and expand my horizons. I believe that the world is a better place when people act selflessly!
											</br></br>
											I am currently a second year graduate student. My past undergraduate research experience consists of some Mathematics (specifically complex analysis), some Acoustics (designing a recording studio), and a little bit of Astronomy (carbon atmosphere white dwarfs). I am currently working with Peter Brown and Nicholas Suntzeff for my graduate research. I look at the UVOT (Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope) Grism spectra of Type II supernovae!

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Taylor Hutchison</font></h3>
											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I'm a Texan -- born and raised -- and haven't had the chance to leave the state yet.  I have two cats that I obsess over and I care for a little forest of plants (which of course my cats treat as free-range salad).  I love hiking, crafting, reading, playing cello, and hanging out and grabbing drinks with friends. I'm a big fan of combining >2 of those activities together as well, makes life more fun :)
											</br></br>
											I'm a 5th year grad student working with Casey, studying the properties of very high redshift (think z > 5) galaxies through near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and photoionization modeling.  These galaxies are so far and faint that I have to use the 10-meter Keck I telescope paired with the super-sensitive MOSFIRE NIR spectrograph to see them.  In the past (i.e., undergrad), I worked with photometry of nearby galaxies, studying their supermassive black holes.  I'm really passionate and curious about galaxies in the early Universe, so I don't see myself moving from this subfield any time soon.

											<h3 class="major"><font color="#F4D03F">Alex Riley</font></h3>
											<h5>he / him / his</h5>
											<p>I'm originally from Cleveland, did my undergrad at UT Dallas, and specifically subscribe to counter-Texan culture (e.g. refusing to say "Howdy!" anywhere in this town). Outside of science, I spend WAAAAY too much time thinking about the current dumpster-fire of U.S. politics (sometimes international politics, too) and often use video games as a form of escapism (currently that means Skyrim or Pokemon Lets Go Eevee). I also play Dungeons and Dragons with several other astro grads and I am trying to get better at cooking.
											</br></br>
											I’m a 4th year grad student, and I work on using cosmological simulations and measurements of Milky Way satellite galaxies to understand a little more about galaxy formation and dark matter. Specifically, I've used new Gaia proper motions to figure out that the Milky Way's stellar disk leaves an imprint on the orbits of Milky Way satellites. Now, I'm working on figuring out which of the bajillion new stellar streams are associated with the so-called Vast Polar Structure of the Milky Way (people argue over whether the Vast Polar Structure exists, and it might actually be a big problem for LCDM if it does).

											<h5>she / her / hers</h5>
											<p>I'm an international student hailing from Ghana, West Africa. When I'm not staring at pixels, I spend time learning about interior decor, watching and discussing movies (I'm a huge Marvel fan), and co-organizing a podcast on intentional living and reachable mentorship (shameless plug -- it's called GrandHeights: StoryVox). I'm a big proponent of authentic, organic, and symbiotic relationships (be it professional, student-advisor, friendships, etc.), and I look forward to being able to help foster them in the MAGIC program.
											</br></br>
											I’m a 4th year graduate student. In undergrad, I used H-alpha emission from high velocity clouds in the Galactic halo to constrain their distances and ionization properties. Currently, I use medium-band near-infrared photometry to improve the photometric redshift solutions of quiescent galaxies at z > 3. I also have expertise in spatially-variable point spread function homogenization. I'm generally interested in extragalactic astronomy and astrostatistics.

											<h5>he / him / his</h5>
											<p>I’m a first generation college student from a small border town in Texas. My interests outside of science include music (I play guitar), cooking, and long distance running. I also spent ~5 years in my twenties trying to get a music career going, and working all types of jobs, before going back to school.
											</br></br>
											I’m a 6th year grad student, and my main area of interest is galaxy evolution. Specifically, I use grism spectra (grism is a slitless and space-based form of spectroscopy) to constrain the assembly histories of massive galaxies in the early universe. My work involves a lot of sophisticated statistical methods and modeling.
